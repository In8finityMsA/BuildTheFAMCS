# BuildTheFAMCS
This 1st year BSU FAMCS speciality Applied Computer Science final project.  
**Game for Android about our faculty.**  
## Idea  
You play as the dean of the faculty. And you have to build a faculty.  
You will need to choose whether to sacrifice the reputation of the administration, money, or students.  
The final depends on your decisions.  
> In the game you can see popular teachers, painfully familiar rooms.

## Technical aspects
#### Requirements
Unity Engine (may require version 2020.3.8f1 or newer).  
Microsoft Visual Studio or Rider. But not required.    
Android.  

#### Features
We've created all textures.

And another mechanics.  
Android methods were used for the controls.
